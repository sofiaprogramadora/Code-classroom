        Ruby is a language created by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto to make programmers happy. It has a very easy way to be written and is very understandable. Ruby is an interpretated language meaning the language does not need to be <strong><code>compiled</code></strong>. Compiling means you need to turn your ruby code to code the machine understand. Instead, the interpreter reads the file  and then compiles it INSIDE of the computer. Which means you don't have to manually test your code all the time. And, you can use Ruby <strong>frameworks</strong> to make very cool websites! Actually, this website was made with the Ruby framework Rails, so this is an example of a website made with Ruby! Cool, right? I will teach you how to make websites like this! Ready? Let's start!
