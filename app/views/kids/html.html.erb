<h1>Welcome to HTML!</h1>
<h3>You will learn how to make websites! Well, not with color, yet. HTML is a <strong>markup language</strong>. That means the code looks like this: <code>&lt;h1&gt;hi&lt;h1&gt;</code>. Do you see the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>s? The things between them (<code>&lt;This&gt;And&lt;/This&gt;</code>) tell the web browser (The app in which you are seeing this) what to display. If you are ready to start, Continue reading!</h3>

<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
<p>So... What exactly is HTML? HTML is a markup programming language. <pre>A programming language is like english, kind of. It is the language computers understand. They read each line, so you can tell the computer <br> <code>clean the dishes <br> make my bed</code><br> And the computer will clean the dishes, when it is done, it will make your bed. The computers understand different programming languages, like you understand different languages! Computer languages, another way of calling them, look somehow like this:<br><code>clean_the_dishes();<br>make_my_bed();<br></code>, but then, how is HTML a programming language? HTML is a <strong>markup language</strong>. It's <strong><a href="#syntax">syntax</a></strong> is different.</pre></p>

<div id="syntax"><h1>Syntax</h1>
<p><h3><strong>What is syntax?</strong></h3>
Syntax is the way you write code. It defines the code you write, still, it does <strong>NOT</strong> give the program a meaning. The program is the final product you get with you code, de execution. A text editor is a program.
<h3><strong>Examples</strong></h3>
As syntax is technicly defined by the language, the language is going to be <a href="<%= kids_javascript_path %>">Javascript</a>.
<br><code>function show(){<br>alert('Hi there, this is an example!');<br>}<br>show();</code><br> This may look weird, let's see an HTML example: <br><code>&lt;h1&gt;hi&lt;h1&gt;</code><br>It may be a little too much, but you will learn. Remember! The more you code, the more you learn!</p></div>
<div id="semantics"><h1><strong></strong></h1><p>
	After this you can start coding! Semantics are what give the program a meaning. So, in HTML, this: <code>&lt;h0&gt;hi&lt;h0&gt;</code> would have a correct syntax, but it does <strong>NOT</strong> have any meaning as &lt;h0&gt; does not do anything. In this tutorial you will learn what is and isn't correct, so, keep reading!

<div id="firstwebsite"><h1>Your first website!</h1>
<p>So... Let's start coding! To make a website, you just need a text editor! Any text editor would work, I recommend Sublime Text 3, and it is the editor I am using for this tutorial. If you use windows then open Notepad, not Word because Word is a RTF (Rich Text Format) editor and we need a TXT (Plain Text) editor. In mac, open TextEdit, and in Ubuntu Linux, use gedit. If you use other Linux distrobutions, just use your default text editor.</p>
<p>Now, in your text editor, create a file and call it index.html <br> Then, in the part where you write, copy this text and paste it in the editor: <br><code>&lt;h1&gt;Hi world!&lt;/h1&gt;</code><br>Then, search for the file. In mac, open finder, in windows open the file explorer. In ubuntu linux open nautilus or your default file browser. double click the file. if you opened it right you should have something like this: <br><pre><div class="browser"><h1>Hi World!</h1></div></pre>Congratulations! You made your first website! Now, try adding <br><code>&lt;h2&gt;Small text&lt;/h2&gt;</code><br>And refresh the page: See the smaller text? It is because you added an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>!The H2 tag is smaller than the H1 tag! The tags define what the content would look like, and act like. The different tags you need to know right now are: <table><tr><th>Tag</th></tr><tr><td><h1>H1</h1></td></tr><tr><td><h2>H2</h2></td></tr><tr><td><h3>H3</h3></td></tr><tr><td><h4>H4</h4></td></tr><tr><td><h5>H5</h5></td></tr><tr><td><h6>H6</h6></td></tr></table><br>
So, the tags go in <strong>lowercase</strong>, and, inside the tags!</p>
<h1>Exercise: </h1>
<p>Try doing the page below in code with the tags!</p>
<pre><div class="browser"><h1>Hi!</h1><h2>This is my page</h2><h3>Check it out!</h3></div></pre></div>
<p>You now know how to make header tags!</p>
